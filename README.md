# Pegmoji

Pegmoji is a console-based game of peg solitaire, based on the specifications from [University of Wisconsin-Madison's CS300 course](https://cs300-www.cs.wisc.edu/wp/peg-solitaire).

The program is implemented entirely in [Emojicode](https://www.emojicode.org).

> Is it called "pegmoji" because the implementation is in Emojicode, rather than the game board being made of emojis?

Yes! I think that having to type emojis into the console to play the game would be rather inconvenient, so the whimsy and wonder of emojis resides in the source code instead.

## Building From Source

```sh
make build
./target/pegmoji
```

or

```sh
